# AutoMotiveX M-Commerce Android Application

AutoMotiveX is a mobile commerce (M-commerce) application designed to transform the automobile spare parts retail and vehicle repair industry by offering a convenient, digital first approach to purchasing spare parts and booking repair services.  

The platform is developed using Android Studio, leveraging Firebase as the primary database for real-time data synchronization and SQLite for local storage in specific functionalities.  With an intuitive user interface, AutoMotiveX enhances both customer convenience and business efficiency, addressing key challenges such as manual appointment booking, inventory mismanagement, and limited market reach.  

The application consists of two main components: the user module and the admin module.  

The user module allows customers to browse and search for spare parts, add products to the cart, make secure online payments, and schedule vehicle repair appointments with ease. Additionally, users can track orders, manage their profiles, and receive notifications for order updates and service reminders.  

The admin module provides shop owners with a centralized dashboard to add and manage products, track sales performance, approve or reject appointment requests, and monitor customer orders.

This system ensures that businesses can efficiently handle their operations while providing a seamless experience for their customers. 

AutoMotiveX integrates secure payment gateways to facilitate online transactions, ensuring reliable and encrypted payments for both customers and business owners. The implementation of Firebase Authentication enhances security by managing user credentials, while Cloud Fire store enables real-time inventory updates. Additionally, SQLite is utilized for storing user session data and enabling limited offline functionality. 

The primary goal of AutoMotiveX is to digitize and optimize automotive service and spare part sales, allowing businesses to expand their reach beyond physical stores and provide a modern, technology-driven experience. With real-time data management, automated workflows, and scalable architecture, the application aims to increase sales, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline operational processes.  

This project represents a future-proof solution in the ever-evolving digital landscape of automobile commerce.
